Learning angular / nodeJS / mongoDB

This is my first time with GitHub, not sure everything done as expected. 

Backend is created with nodeJS (express & mongoDB), front-end is with angular.

Lot of code fixing and cleaning done lately, lot of shorter and cleaner code. Code dublications removed, for-loops replaced with built-in array methods etc..
