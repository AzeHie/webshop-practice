Learning angular / nodeJS / mongoDB

This is my first time with GitHub, not sure everything done as expected. 

Backend is created with nodeJS (express & mongoDB), front-end is with angular.

Files uploaded afterwards, when project was "ready". Some parts missing, like accessories and gift cards etc, but I continued forward to learn other technologies/things. There is also some pointless code duplications, I'm currently working with them.
