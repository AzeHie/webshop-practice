Learning angular / nodeJS / mongoDB

This is my first time with GitHub, not sure everything done as expected. 

Backend is created with nodeJS (express & mongoDB), front-end is with angular.

This project has been HUGE practice for me. There has been lot of bug fixing, error solving and good repeat for all the things I've learned in the last couple years. I've been writing code with a lot of dublications for the better practice, of course I've removed those dublications later though, because I wanted the code to be as clean as possible. 

The lastest things I've done for this project are:
  1. Some for-loops replaced with built-in array methods, 
  2. Lot of pointless code and code dublications cleaned and replaced with better solutions, 
  3. Couple services integrated into each other..

For now, this project looks ready for me. Of course there is some parts still missing - like accessories, gift cards, about-us pages etc. But I think it's time to move on and continue to learn new technologies (REACT & JAVA) and of course some new projects too.
