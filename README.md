# webshop-practice
Learning angular / nodeJS / mongoDB

ONLY INCLUDES THE FILES I'VE CREATED / EDITED, NOT THE FULL PROJECT (basic angular files etc. missing)
FILES UPLOADED AFTERWARDS, WHEN PROJECT WERE "READY" (SOME PARTS MISSING LIKE ACCESSORIES AND GIFT CARDS ETC, BUT I CONTINUED LEARNING ELSEWHERE)
