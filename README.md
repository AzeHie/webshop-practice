Learning angular / nodeJS / mongoDB

This is my first time with GitHub, not sure everything done as expected..

Files uploaded afterwards, when project was "ready". Some parts missing, like accessories and gift cards etc, but I continued forward to learn other technologies (react)

There is some pointless code duplications, I wanted to do some things couple times for better practice and didn't clean all the code after that
